# "hosts" is a list of devices we want to connect to in order
# to run our tests. You can think of it like a very basic
# inventory, containing all of the information JSNAPy needs
# to connect to each of our devices programmatically and
# retrieve state.
hosts:
  - device: r1
    username : root
    passwd: antidotepassword
    port: 22
  - device: r2
    username : root
    passwd: antidotepassword
    port: 22
  - device: r3
    username : root
    passwd: antidotepassword
    port: 22

# "tests" is a list of references to files that contain tests
# to run. We'll explore this file in a little bit.
tests:
  - snapshot0.yaml
