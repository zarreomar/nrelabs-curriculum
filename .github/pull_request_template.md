**High-Level Overview of this Curriculum Contribution**:

<!--

It's really hard to understand the "why" behind a curriculum contribution/PR just by looking at the files diff.
Take a minute to explain the intention behind your contribution, such as why you built this, and
the kind of audience you had in mind for the content.

Some ideas:
1. Is this a brand new lesson, or an additional stage/lab for an existing lesson?
2. If a new lesson, how does this relate (if applicable) to existing lesson content? Is there overlap, or dependent
   relationships with existing content?
3. Who is your ideal audience/learners for this content?

**Content Outline**:

<!-- if this is a new lesson please provide an outline for this lesson. This would be similar to a "table of contents" in a book, where your lesson is the book, and each stage is a chapter. For each stage, give a single bullet briefly describing each, what what will be learned in them. -->

**Does this PR fix an existing issue?**:
<!--
*Please use this to automatically close linked issue when PR is merged.
Usage: `Fixes #<issue number>`, or `Fixes (paste link of issue)`.

State "None" if there is no existing issue to be closed.
